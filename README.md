# Udemy - React App - Adding Users via Form Submission

This repository aims to compile all aspects of React concepts, whether refreshed or new, in order to build a web application from scratch.

## The App 

- A form that outputs a list of users based on validation criteria and state management. Error handling is conditionally managed if the form submission criteria is not met.

## Concepts covered

- Creating reusable, dynamic components
- State Management
- Form Validation
- Resetting Logic based on state
- Managing a User List by using the .map() method in conjunction with previous state
- Conditional error messaging based on error state 

*This README file will be updated as the project continues development*.
